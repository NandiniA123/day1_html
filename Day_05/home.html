"MTIET - An epitome of excellence"

Mother Theresa Institute of Engineering and Technology, a premier Engineering College, was established in the year 2010 with the objective of developing competent and responsible technocrats for the futuristic needs of India. Promoted by "Holy Cross Educational Society, Palamaner". MTIET is built on the spirited commitment and passion to impart quality education to the rural and remote student aspirant of technical education.
